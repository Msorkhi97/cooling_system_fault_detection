# Cooling System Fault Detection (Sample)

## Overview  
This project is a **time series classification model** designed to detect faults in a car's cooling system. It leverages deep learning techniques to analyze sensor data and classify the system's condition as either **healthy** or **faulty**.

## Features  
- Uses **Conv1D-based neural networks** for time series classification  
- Works with **engine coolant temperature** and **ambient air temperature** as input features  
- Preprocessed **sensor data** from real-world vehicle diagnostics  
- Designed for **automated fault detection** in automotive cooling systems  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of time-series recordings from vehicle sensors, with each sample containing:  
- **Coolant temperature readings** over 300 time steps  
- **Ambient air temperature** as an additional numerical feature  
- Labeled data for **faulty** and **healthy** conditions  

## Usage  
This repository provides:  
- **Preprocessing scripts** for data transformation  
- A **deep learning model** for classification  
- Training and evaluation scripts  

## Future Work  
- Enhancing model accuracy with additional sensor inputs  
- Implementing real-time fault detection in automotive systems  

## License  
This project is open-source and available under the **MIT License**.
